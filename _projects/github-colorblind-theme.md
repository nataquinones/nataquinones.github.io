# github-colorblind-theme

This project started from a conversation I saw on Twitter (R.I.P.), where someone with colorblindness pointed out that GitHub's red/green color scheme for diffs wasn’t accessible, and, at the time, GitHub didn’t offer any colorblind-friendly alternatives (!!). So I put together a quick CSS theme using the Stylus browser extension to make GitHub more readable for colorblind users. GitHub has since added [official accesible themes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/accessibility/managing-your-theme-settings), which is great to see. Still, this approach can be useful for other sites too, as it just layers custom CSS over any webpage. (I actually use it for Jupyter Lab themes!)
