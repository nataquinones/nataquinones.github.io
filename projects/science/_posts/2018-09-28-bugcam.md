I wrote this to monitor timelapse photography experiments. It checks a given Dropbox folder and alerts through a Slack Bot if it detects that an expected photo is not present in a specified period of time, or if there's an abrupt change in the picture brightness.

The project is incomplete, but it is a good example of how to use `Pillow`, `Advanced Python Scheduler ` and the `Dropbox` and `Slack Clients`.
