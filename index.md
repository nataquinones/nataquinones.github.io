I am currently a graduate student in the [Baym Lab](https://baymlab.hms.harvard.edu) through the [Harvard Systems Biology Graduate Program](https://ssqbiophd.hms.harvard.edu). I did my undergraduate education at the [National Autonomous University of Mexico](http://132.248.10.125/index.php/about-us/), where I majored in Biology.

I study mobile genetic elements in bacteria, with a combination of dry and wet lab methods. I am particularly interested in the interaction between plasmids and bacteriophages.
